# Expo Android App Intermittent Crashes

This repository demonstrates an issue where an Expo managed workflow application crashes intermittently on Android devices without providing a clear error message.  The crash is inconsistent and doesn't reveal a specific cause in the logs. This example highlights the difficulty in debugging such unpredictable crashes.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application on an Android emulator or device using `expo start --android`. 
4. Navigate between screens or perform actions within the app. Observe the unpredictable crashes. The app may function correctly sometimes but crash at others without an obvious reason or detailed error message.

## Potential Solutions and Debugging Approaches

The solution involves thoroughly analyzing possible causes of the crash.  This often requires detailed debugging of native modules, inspecting Android logs more meticulously, and potentially using a crash reporting service with more extensive diagnostic capabilities.  Testing across various devices and configurations is also crucial to isolate factors that contribute to the crash.
