Debugging these types of crashes requires a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Enable Extensive Logging:** Add detailed console logs at various points in your application's lifecycle, especially during navigation and potentially problematic actions. This can help pinpoint the area where the crash occurs.

2. **Use a Crash Reporting Service:** Integrate a crash reporting service like Sentry, Firebase Crashlytics, or Bugsnag. These services provide more comprehensive crash reports, often including stack traces from the native side and additional context that is not available in basic Expo logging.

3. **Check Native Modules:** Examine any native modules you're using.  A bug in a native module can cause unexpected crashes without providing useful error information in JavaScript code. Ensure those modules are up to date and well-maintained. 

4. **Android Logcat Inspection:** Carefully review the Android Logcat logs. Sometimes, clues hidden in the native logs can provide a more precise indication of the crash's cause. Use filters to focus on log entries related to your app.

5. **Test on Various Devices:** Run the app on various Android emulators and physical devices with different Android versions and configurations to isolate issues that might be device-specific or related to specific Android versions. 

6. **Simplify the App:** If the problem persists, try to create a minimal reproducible example that exhibits the same behavior. Removing unnecessary components will isolate the problematic code and make debugging much easier.
