While developing an Expo managed workflow application, I encountered an unusual issue where the application would crash intermittently on Android devices, specifically when navigating between screens or performing certain actions. The crash reports provided no clear indication of the root cause, showing only a generic native crash without a stack trace or specific error message. This behavior was inconsistent; sometimes the app would run without problems, and at other times it would crash unexpectedly.
